Python Tutoring Notes
========
Week 1
-----
* Planning
	* Background knowledge check
	* Goal of this tutoring session
	* How much time to spend every week on it
	* Homework and labs
* Software vs. Hardware
* Programs - a.k.a "Softwares"
	* Operating sysmtems, applications, etc.
* Machine Language - basic CPU instructions
	* Completely numeric (binary), computer "readable"
	* Specific to particular computer types - not portable
	* This is why we need a High-Level Computer Language
* Programming language
	* Portable and can be transferred between different machines
	* Translated to machine language by compilers
* Different Types of Programming Langage
	* Procedural languages - C, Pascal, BASIC
	* Object-oriented languages - Java, C++
	* Multi-paradigm languages - Python 	
* Python IDLE and Python Program
	* IDLE is the application that we use to interact with Python programs 
	* If you want to write Python programs, you will put all the program code inside a text file with the file name extension `.py`
	* Then you can run the program with Python IDLE
* Terminal
	* Terminal is much more powerful than the Python IDLE, and is crucial in learning programming, we will spend some time talking about it next week.
* Running your first python code `Hello World!` 

* **Homework**:
	* Install the latest `Python 3`
		* You may consult this website: 
		* https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp
	* Install `pytest` for your `python 3`
	* Successfully print `Hello World!` using `python` in your terminal
	* Find 5 examples for each type of programming languages
	* Suppose you are writing a computer program to
